"""Embedding the visualizer's native window into a Tk frame (Windows only).

Windows-only: reparenting an arbitrary native window by handle is a
Win32-specific operation; there is no equivalent here for other platforms,
so there the visualizer keeps its own separate top-level window instead
(still fully functional, just not embedded).

VTK's own ``SetParentId`` (create the render window as a child to begin
with) was tried first and rejected: it fails outright on this VTK build
(``vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow``, error 1400/ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE,
confirmed by direct testing, both via the SWIG-encoded pointer string and a
``ctypes.c_void_p``). Reparenting the already-created top-level window
after the fact -- strip its WS_POPUP/title-bar styles, ``SetParent`` it
under the Tk frame, ``MoveWindow`` it to fill that frame -- works reliably
and is the standard Win32 technique for embedding a foreign window.
