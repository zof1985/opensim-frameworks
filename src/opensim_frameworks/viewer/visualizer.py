"""An in-process, interactive VTK visualizer for an ``opensim.Model``.

Replaces the native Simbody visualizer (``opensim.ModelVisualizer``) that
:meth:`~opensim_frameworks.viewer.show` used to open: that
visualizer runs as a *separate process* (a bundled ``simbody-visualizer``
executable) communicating over a pipe, and its own
``Visualizer.InputListener`` interface exposes exactly three callbacks --
``keyPressed``, ``menuSelected``, ``sliderMoved`` -- with no mouse-move/
hover event, no camera-transform getter (only a setter, and the user can
freely orbit/pan/zoom with the mouse, which is never reported back), and
no picking/ray-intersection API at all. There is therefore no way to know
where the mouse is over that window, or what is under it.

VTK's ``vtkRenderWindowInteractor``, by contrast, runs *in this same
process*: its ``MouseMoveEvent`` fires here, its camera transform is
always readable, and ``vtkCellPicker`` resolves a screen pixel to both a
3D world point and the actor under it -- exactly what a live coordinate/
component readout needs. The tradeoff is reimplementing geometry loading
(meshes and the native ``Brick``/``Cylinder``/``Sphere`` primitives) and
visuals that the Simbody visualizer provided for free; this module covers
only what :meth:`opensim.Model.show` and the playback window
(:mod:`opensim_frameworks.viewer.player`) actually need.

The interactor's own blocking ``Start()`` event loop is never used: it runs
a native Win32 message loop in C++ that does not release the GIL, so even
on its own background thread it stalls every other Python thread in the
process (confirmed directly -- a plain
``threading.Thread(target=interactor.Start).start()`` hangs the calling
thread's very next line). Instead, :meth:`VTKVisualizer.process_events`
wraps ``vtkRenderWindowInteractor.ProcessEvents()``, a single non-blocking
pump of pending window messages; :mod:`opensim_frameworks.viewer.player` calls it
once per tick of its own Tk ``after()`` loop, on the same thread as Tk's
event processing, so one thread drives both GUIs without contention.

For the same reason, a ``VTKVisualizer`` must be *constructed* on that
same thread too, not handed over from another one afterward: its native
window is thread-affine (a plain Win32 rule -- a window's messages are
only ever delivered to the thread that created it), and
:mod:`opensim_frameworks.viewer.player` additionally reparents that window into its
own Tk frame, a call that blocks waiting for the *creating* thread to
process it -- which deadlocks if that thread is the caller's and has
already moved on past ``show()``, as confirmed directly. ``_player.py``'s
``start_player`` is therefore what constructs every ``VTKVisualizer``,
never :meth:`~opensim_frameworks.viewer.show` itself.

A pure-white actor on a near-white background looks exactly like a blank/
broken render at a glance -- confirmed the hard way, chasing a GL-context
red herring across several reparenting-timing variants before noticing
the *background* was rendering correctly all along and only the
(uncoloured, default-white) actor itself was invisible against it.
:meth:`_add_body_actors` sets an explicit material colour for exactly
this reason -- it is a visibility fix, not a cosmetic one.

    """Build the camera interactor style: left-drag rotates, Ctrl+left-drag pans, wheel zooms.

    A thin remap of ``vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera``'s own modifier ->
    action dispatch (which already reserves Shift+left for Pan and plain
    Ctrl+left for Spin): a Ctrl-held left-drag is presented to the base
    implementation as if Shift were held instead (and Ctrl released),
    since that is the branch it already treats as Pan -- reusing its own
    ``FindPokedRenderer``/``GrabFocus``/``StartPan`` machinery rather than
    reimplementing it. The real modifier state is restored immediately
    after, since the base class's ``OnMouseMove``/``OnLeftButtonUp`` only
    ever dispatch off ``State`` (set by ``StartPan``/``StartRotate``
    during ``OnLeftButtonDown``), never by re-reading modifier keys
    themselves mid-drag. Plain rotate and mouse-wheel zoom are left as the
    base class's own default behaviour unchanged -- which already does
    nothing on a plain click (rotation amount comes purely from mouse-move
    delta while the button is down, so zero movement is zero rotation).

    The returned style must be kept alive for as long as it's installed on
    an interactor (e.g. as an instance attribute): VTK's Python-override
    dispatch for a virtual method like ``OnLeftButtonDown`` requires the

    underlying C++ object's own reference count.

        this one's actors are fixed at construction time.
    embed : callable or None, optional
        If given, called once, with this visualizer's native window
        handle (:meth:`get_window_id`'s value), after the window exists
        but before its first paint -- :mod:`opensim_frameworks.viewer.player`
        passes a callback that reparents it into its own Tk frame right
        then.
    offscreen : bool, optional
        Render without creating an interactive render-window interactor.
        Used by :func:`opensim_frameworks.save_animation` to export video
        without opening a window. Defaults to ``False``.
    size : tuple[int, int], optional
        Render-window dimensions in pixels as ``(width, height)``.
