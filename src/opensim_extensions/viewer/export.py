"""Save the player's current 3D view as an image, or a loaded motion as a video.

Used by the "Export" controls in :mod:`opensim_extensions.viewer.player` -- kept
separate from that module since these are pure render/encode operations
(no Tk widgets), independently testable/reusable without a live window.
``render_motion_animation`` reuses the player's existing visualizer; the
off-screen :func:`opensim_extensions.viewer.animation.save_animation` creates
its own visualizer for a model and motion table.
